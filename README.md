# Welcome

This is the source code for the web site of Nick Taylor built using the [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) static site generator. It uses [Andy Bell](https://piccalil.li/)'s [Hylia template](https://github.com/hankchizljaw/hylia). I've made tweaks to it and will probably make more over time, but just wanted to give Andy a shout out for his awesome template.

## Terminal commands

### Install the dependencies first

```bash
npm install
```

### Serve the site locally in watch mode

```bash
npm start
```

### Build a production version of the site

```bash
npm run production
```

#### Test the production site locally

```bash
cd dist
npx serve
```

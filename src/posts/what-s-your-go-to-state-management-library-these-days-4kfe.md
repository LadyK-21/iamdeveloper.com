We use [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) at [Forem](https://forem.com), the software that powers dev.to, but we do not use a state management library, just good old component state.

The last state management library I used was Redux back in Fall of 2018. If you require a state management library for your project, I'm curious which one do you use? [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/), [Recoil](https://recoiljs.org/) etc. or is it something more like [React Query](https://github.com/tannerlinsley/react-query) these days?

Also, what do you like/dislike about the state management library you use?

Go!

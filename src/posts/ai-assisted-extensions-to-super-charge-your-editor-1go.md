Most editors have extensions. Did you know there are some AI assisted extensions to help super charge your coding experience?

## Visual Studio Code Intellicode

The first tool is for Visual Studio Code only.

VS Code has their own extension called [Visual Studio Code Intellicode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioExptTeam.vscodeintellicode)

From the extension web page, "The Visual Studio IntelliCode extension provides AI-assisted development features for Python, TypeScript/JavaScript and Java developers in Visual Studio Code, with insights based on understanding your code context combined with machine learning."

Check out this video explaining Intellicode

## Tabnine

There's also another product called [Tabnine](https://www.tabnine.com/). From the company web site, "Tabnine was created to help developers code faster, reduce mistakes, and discover best coding practices using Machine Learning."

## Kite

There is also [Kite](https://www.kite.com/integrations/vs-code/). From the company web site, "Experience lightning fast completions that are context aware of your code."

[Ania KubÃ³w](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5DNytAJ6_FISueUfzZCVsw) has a video that evaluates Tabnine and Kite.

I started with Intellicode, but have been using Tabnine lately in VS Code.

Give them all a try and let me know which one you ended up using!

P.S.: If youâ€™re a fan of VS Code, I run a Twitter handle for VS Code tips called [@vscodetips](https://twitter.com/vscodetips). ðŸ˜Ž

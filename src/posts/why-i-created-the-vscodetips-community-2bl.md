I'm a big fan of Visual Studio Code. I was an early adopter. I started using VS Code in 2015. I was working at a Microsoft technology based company and the project I was on was to include TypeScript, pretty new at the time even though TypeScript had existed since 2012.

The only editor to my knowledge at the time that supported TypeScript was VS Code. And so began my VS Code journey. In the early days, it was literally just an editor. There was no support for extensions. I kept on using it as I was on several other TypeScript projects between 2015-2017.

When extensions became available, it was the beginning of a [beautiful ecosystem](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) of ways to extend VS Code.

Fast forward to 2021 and not only do we have extensions and themes, but amazing technologies like [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MS-vsliveshare.vsliveshare-pack), [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces), and other spaces that provide a VS Code experience such as [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io/), [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/), and [CodeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io).

Whenever I go to edit code online now, I expect the VS Code experience. ðŸ˜Ž

Being a fan of VS Code, I decided to create a [vscodetips Twitter handle](https://twitter.com/vscodetips) back in September of 2017. Over the past 4 years, the vscodetips Twitter community has gotten modestly large at just over 5000 followers.

I work at [Forem](https://forem.com), where we build community software that powers sites like DEV and the [CodeNewbie community](https://community.codenewbie.org/). I put out a poll to see if folks would be interested in a community site to compliment the Twitter account.

The majority of folks that responded seemed on board with a community site.

All that to say [community.vscodetips.com](https://community.vscodetips.com) is live!

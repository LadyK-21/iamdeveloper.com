Hey awesome devs! For those of you that have been contributing to open source, do you have examples of issues or pull requests (PRs) that you thought really stood out? They can be yours or someone else's from any publicly accessible code base.

The goal is to provide a list of links to great examples that new and seasoned open source enthusiasts can look to for inspiration when creating their own issues and PRs.

For example, an issue that explained a problem really well with steps to reproduce it that also provided the environment it happened in.

Maybe a PR that was crafted really well that had before and after screenshots if it was UI related and/or steps to test it, there were unit tests etc.

Alright go!

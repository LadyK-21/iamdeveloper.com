My talk at the June 13th, 2017 [js-montreal](http://js-montreal.org) meetup slides are available at [storybookslides.iamdeveloper.com](https://storybookslides.iamdeveloper.com). This was the first time I attended the js-montreal meetup. It was good to meet lots of new folks. Looking forward to the next one.

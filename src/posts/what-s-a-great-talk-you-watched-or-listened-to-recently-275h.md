I came across a great talk by [James Long](https://twitter.com/jlongster) tonight that he gave at [dotJS](https://www.dotjs.io/) 2019. I really enjoyed it and definitely recommend that you give it a watch.

This one happens to be software related, but what is a great talk (any topic) that you watched or listened to recently?

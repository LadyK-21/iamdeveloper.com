I'm completely new to Ruby, but am not a stranger to backend dev (.NET, Nodejs).

I've checked out the [Ruby Quick start](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/quickstart/), but aside from that, what resources, whether they be books, online resources, videos etc. would you recommend to someone looking to get into the world of Ruby and Ruby on Rails?

Bonus points if you can suggest an e-book before I go camping in three hours? ðŸ˜œ

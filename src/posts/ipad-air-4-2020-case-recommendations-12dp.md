I'm upgrading my super old iPad to the iPad Air 4 (2020). I've been doing a lot of research for a great cover, but there are so many brands and models.

In terms of criteria:

* I do not need a keyboard integrated. I have a small foldable one already.
* Shouldn't be too bulky, but still be able to protect the device really well
* All cutouts should expose ports, camera, mic, speakers really well. (There are some that don't)
* Be able to hold and protect an Apple Pencil

I've been leaning towards some cases from ESR, but I'm wondering if anyone has recommendations for a case with that criteria?

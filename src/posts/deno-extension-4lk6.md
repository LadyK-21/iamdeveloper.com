If you're not familiar with [Deno](https://deno.land/), it's a runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript started by the creator of Node.js.

Tonight I discovered there is a [VS Code extension for Deno](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno) that adds support for the Deno [language server](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/language-extensions/language-server-extension-guide).

You can read more about [getting VS Code setup for Deno in the official docs](https://deno.land/manual/vscode_deno).

Curious what everyone is listening to for podcasts these days, whether it be technical or not. ~~I've been listening to Joe Rogan lately. They're long, but he has interesting guests from all walks of life. Maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but I've been enjoying his podcast.~~ **Update 2020:** I had only listened to a few of his podcast episodes but did not realize in other episodes that I had not listened to, they were causing harm and danger to folks. So definitely off my podcast list.

I also recently discovered the Script & Style podcast with Todd Gardner and David Walsh. Not sure why this one hadn't already popped up on my radar.

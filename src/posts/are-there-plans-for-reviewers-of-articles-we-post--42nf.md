Since last October, I've started to blog more, and have been slowly adding some   articles on dev.to. Usually when I want a review of something, I'll tweet it to the planet and if someone bites, they may review it from my repo on GitHub for an unpublished article. I find this process a little clunky.

I was wondering if there are plans (if not I'm suggesting ðŸ˜‰) to allow other members of dev.to to review articles before an author publishes so they can get additional feedback.

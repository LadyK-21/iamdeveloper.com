The title says it all. I started a JavaScript (JS) Twitch stream!

As some of you know, I co-host the [DEV Twitch stream](https://twitch.tv/thepracticaldev). I'm also learning Rust on Tuesdays on my own stream.

But now there is some JavaScript goodness too. I decided to start streaming on Thursdays at 2pm UTC (10am Eastern for me) for an hour about all things JavaScript.

To follow along visit [JavaScriptHours.com](https://JavaScriptHours.com)

So what is the purpose of the stream? Well it's a few things:
* Do some katas to get back in the habit
* Answering folks questions in the stream. I can't guarantee I will have all the answers (who does?), but we can have fun figuring it out if I don't know. ðŸ˜Ž
* Anything JS related honestly, including TypeScript
* Hanging with all you awesome folks on the stream.

If you missed the inaugural stream, here's the recording up on YouTube.

We covered the following on the first stream:
* purpose of the stream
* some katas from jskatas.org
* object and array spread

Come by and lurk, ask questions, or just move a lobster or doughnut for fun on the screen!

See you at the next stream!

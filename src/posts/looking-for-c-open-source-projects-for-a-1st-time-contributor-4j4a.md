Hey awesome devs at DEV. I have an acquaintance that is looking at getting into open source via a C# project. Any recommendations for projects that have good first issues, documentation updates etc.?

I've been out of the .NET landscape since 2016, so I'm a bit out of the loop in regards to all the open source stuff happening in the .NET ecosystem.

Maybe @turnerj or @integerman have some ideas?

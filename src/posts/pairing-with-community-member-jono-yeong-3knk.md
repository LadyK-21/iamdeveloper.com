On <time datetime="2021-02-17">February 17th</time>, DEV Community member [Jono Yeong](https://dev.to/jonoyeong) joined [Christina](https://dev.to/coffeecraftcode) and I on the pairing stream to work on an issue related to wanting to render HTML tags as text.

Here is the issue that we were working on:

{% github "https://github.com/forem/forem/issues/2204" %}

### On this stream, we covered:

* **Debugging tools in the browser**, which helped us solve the issue
* **[Cross Site Scripting](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/)** (XSS) mitigation -- a security in place that was causing the issue we were working on.
* How to retain security best practices while still allowing this issue to be fixed.

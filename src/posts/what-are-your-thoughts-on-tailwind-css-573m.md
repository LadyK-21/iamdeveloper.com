I'm curious what people's thoughts are on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com). I'm a big fan of [Refactoring UI](https://refactoringui.com/) (part of my [frontend developer resources](https://dev.to/nickytonline/frontend-developer-resources-246j)), so that's how I came across Tailwind.

The use of utility classes seems appealing, but also potentially overwhelming. On the other hand, having all these utility classes could be nice instead of going all bespoke.

I have not used it myself, but I'm planning on doing so in the very near future to take it for a test drive. I'm curious what others experience in the community has been using it.

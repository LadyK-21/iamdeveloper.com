I don't know if I'll keep doing this every year, but I did one of these in 2020 and that post got some good signal, so I renamed it to Frontend Developer Resources 2020 which brings us to Frontend Developer Resources 2022. Oops, I missed 2021. Technically we're still in 2021, but humour me. ðŸ˜Ž

This is not a complete list, more a list of stuff I found compelling in 2021 that will keep you set in 2022 and on and builds off of my previous list. You may see some repeats in here from my previous post, but that's only because they're still super relevant.

Most resources are free, but some are paid. I also highly recommend an [egghead.io](https://egghead.io) subscription. I've been a happy subscriber for quite a while now.

If you have an educational stipend at work, use it. Also, a lot of public libraries give you access for free to paid resources like LinkedIn Learning. Check out your local library before purchasing certain content. Also, just a huge shoutout to public libraries. ðŸ˜Ž

I work with Preact in my day to day and I also work with React. There are obviously other libraries and frameworks out there, but I'm going to veer away from all that in this post. The only mention I'll make is in the browser extensions section.

This is a work in progress, so expect this list to be updated over the course of 2022.

## JavaScript

Regardless of whether or not you start with a library or framework, at some point as a frontend developer, you will need to understand JavaScript in more depth. Here's some good resources to get you there.

- [JavaScript Katas](https://jskatas.org)

- [Philip Roberts](https://twitter.com/philip_roberts) talk at JSConf EU "What the heck is the event loop anyway?" is a great explanation of the event loop.

## TypeScript

TypeScript is getting more and more popular every year. Even if you're not a fan of it, it's good to be at least aware of it.

## CSS

Let's skip the centering jokes in CSS. We're in the 2020's now and this is something fairly easy to do nowadays. Dig in and level up on your CSS.

## Testing

- I'm a fan of Cypress and we use it at Forem (the software that powers dev.to). We've been building out our documentation over time, and I think it's a really great resource if you dive into end to end testing. Check out [Writing Cypress Tests](https://developers.forem.com/tests/e2e-tests#writing-cypress-tests)
- Testing library's suite of tools. Whether it's component tests in React, Svelte, plain old HTML/CSS/JS or end to end testing, [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/) has you covered.

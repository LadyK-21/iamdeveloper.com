Iâ€™ve configured webpacker to be able to [process ERBs](https://github.com/rails/webpacker#erb) (`bundle exec rails webpacker:install:erb`) because I need paths generated by Sprockets' `asset_path` at build time so that I get properly generated asset URLs.

The ERB integration works with the simple example that you get after installing ERB/Webpacker integration, but Iâ€™m wondering how to have access to `asset_path`. From what Iâ€™ve found so far, it doesnâ€™t appear to be possible, https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/284.

Does anyone know if it's possible? In the meantime, I will keep digging ðŸ˜‰

A few weeks ago, I wrote a post asking DEV community members if they wanted to potentially pair program with me during a live coding session.

A lot of interest was generated and so we did our first live coding pairing session that was streamed on [doingdevfordev.com](https://doingdevfordev.com). It was with DEV community member Sophia Li.

She worked on the
`<ImageUploader />`
Preact component in the DEV/forem codebase. It was originally a class component that she converted to a function component using the [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html# usestate) hook.

For the full recording of the pairing session check out the YouTube video below. Also, feel free to subscribe to [my channel](https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCBLlEq0co24VFJIMEHNcPOQ). ðŸ˜‰

Near the end of the pairing session we discussed the possibility of using the [useReducer](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html# usereducer) hook instead. After the pairing session, Sophia continued working on the PR she created and implemented the necessary changes to use the
`useReducer`
hook.

For those interested, here is the merged PR.

It was awesome pairing with Sophia and by the way, sheâ€™s looking for her next role!

Looking forward to the next pairing session!

I just opened an issue in the dev.to repo in regards to considering standardizing units of measure in the CSS part of the codebase. In a nutshell, I'm promoting the usage of
`rem`
(and
`em`
when necessary) like I use in my day to day at work as I'm sold on
`rem`
.

There are many articles that have discussed this in detail. A simple Google of "rem vs." will provide you with an abundance of articles.

I'm curious what everyone's thoughts are on this. Feel free to comment here as well as in the GitHub issue.

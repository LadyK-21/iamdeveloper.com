A while back, I wrote about [My Mac Setup](https://mac.iamdeveloper.com) (yes, shameless plug ðŸ˜„). I have it pretty much tweaked to make me productive, but there was one thing that always bugged me.

Every time a native dialog popped, I couldn't tab through the buttons. For whatever reason, I just assumed that this was how it was in macOS but at the same time I was like how is this not available in the OS? Well tonight, I was being interrupted in my keystroke flow by a native dialog once again and hit the tipping point where I couldn't take it anymore.

A very quick Google (why did I not do this before), revealed it is indeed possible via settings buried deep in the Keyboard settings. Big thanks to this article, [Use the Tab Key to Switch Between Dialog Buttons in Mac OS X](http://osxdaily.com/2010/02/26/use-the-tab-key-to-switch-between-dialog-buttons-in-mac-os-x). I am now a happy camper.

What other hidden macOS secrets or unobvious settings do you know that could help another dev out?

## The project
So this past week I built out my second dApp with the current cohort in the [Buildspace](https://buildspace.so) community. This time round, the project was to create an NFT based game. The goal was to make a game where you could attack a big boss via a transaction on the blockchain that would use a game smart contract.

So like the previous dApp, this required some knowledge of Solidity to build out our smart contact, [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) to help us develop our dApp with ETH, and some frontend skills (React and JavaScript).

The project provides a template for the frontend part, but once again I used my [web3 starter project](https://github.com/nickytonline/web3-starter). The benefit of building out with the web3 starter is I'm improving the starter project. ðŸ˜Ž

## Going off script

Like the first dApp I built, I made it my own. Here's some fun screenshots from the game I made.

If you're interested in how it's all built, I've open sourced it. Iâ€™m sure thereâ€™s some refactoring to do, but Iâ€™m really happy hour it turned out.

If you want to just check out the game, head on over to [nftgame.iamdeveloper.com](https://nftgame.iamdeveloper.com). Note that it's only on the Rinkeby test network so no real coin will be used.

Until next time!

This past weekend I completed a [web3](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-web3/) project from the awesome folks at [buildspace](https://buildspace.so).

The project was building out a [dapp](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/dapps/) that allows you to send messages and store them on the blockchain. Under the hood, it was [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) for the [smart contract](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/smart-contracts/), TypeScript, [NEXT.js](https://nextjs.org/), [Theme UI](https://theme-ui.com/), good old semantic markup, and a splash of ARIA in the frontend. Shoutout to the 
`<details />`
 element! Aside from that, some other web3 goodies like [hardhat](https://hardhat.org).

The buildspace projects have really straightforward instructions. I did go a bit rogue though. I recently created a web3 starter, and decided to use that as the base for my first foray into dapp development.

I also decided to make the project my own and made some modifications. For one, I added another field for the message in the smart contract for storing a URL. I was doing this quickly, so just opted to use images from a funny site I love, [http.cat](https://http.cat).

The code is still a bit scrappy as it really was a weekend project, but I'm still happy with how it turned out. I've made some tweaks since then, but there's still a bunch of refactoring to do. ðŸ˜…

If you're into TypeScript, there's a couple examples of declaration merging [like this one to get the 
`<marquee />`
 element in JSX](https://github.com/nickytonline/picture-portal/blob/main/@types/global.d.ts# L3-L10).

The dapp is live running the contract off the [Rinkeby network](https://www.rinkeby.io/). Feel free to check out the dapp's source code.

This week's tip is coming in a bit late. I had a bit of a busy week. There's another contender for testing and creating APIs. The [RapidAPI Client extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RapidAPI.vscode-rapidapi-client).

> RapidAPI Client is a full-featured HTTP client that lets you test and describes the APIs you build or consume. Designed to work with your VS Code themes, RapidAPI Client makes composing requests, inspecting server responses, generating client code for API calls, and typesafe objects for application development simple and intuitive.

I've just installed it so I haven't done too much with it yet, but grab it yourself and let them know what you think about the extension.

Happy VS Coding!

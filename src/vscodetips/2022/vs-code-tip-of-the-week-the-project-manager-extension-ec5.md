This week's VS Code Tip of the Week is the https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.project-manager. This extension has been around for a while, but it's so useful. I literally use this everyday.

This extension allows you to manage projects, where projects are a folder that you're project lives in.

## Pick a project to open

Press CMD + Option + P to load your list of projects then use the keyboard or mouse to select the project you want to load.

## Add a project to the list of projects

In a project that hasn't been added to the list of project's managed my the Project Manager extension? Press CMD + Shift + P to load the command menu and type in `save project`, The command to save a project appears. Use the keyboard or mouse to select the command.

By default it will populate the command menu with the project name defaulting to the folder name where the project lives. Keep the default name or rename it then press enter to save the project.

Now when you go open the list of projects, your new project will be in the list.

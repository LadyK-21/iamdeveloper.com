<p>I
  <a href="/posts/i-ve-started-to-live-code-on-twitch-for-dev-13cn/">started live coding</a>
  on Twitch at the end of March 2020. It started off as a small experiment, and then I started getting into a groove. Initially I was live coding by myself, but then I thought it might be fun and helpful to engage with the folks that contribute to the open source project I work on,
  <a href="https://forem.com">Forem</a>, the code that runs
  <a href="https://dev.to">DEV</a>.</p>

<h2>Walkthrough Wednesdays</h2>
<p>Every second week on the
  <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thepracticaldev">DEV Twitch stream</a>, we interview someone from the tech space.</p>

<h2>Live Coding Pairings</h2>

<iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL8Bb2WLXhUaBGrYRnmDaF73LDCjEGzjIE" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe>

<p>The goal of these pairings is a few things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It's potentially intimidating for people to contribute to an open source project, so why not help them out?</li>
  <li>Some folks are looking to land their first role. I thought this could be a great way to give them some exposure and confidence to help them along their way to landing that first role while contributing to a real world code base.</li>
  <li>They are
    <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/">learning in public</a>
    because we are streaming on the Internet.</li>
  <li>It's fun meeting people from the community.</li>
  <li>I potentially get to learn new things as well!</li>
</ul>

<h2>My Own Twitch Channel</h2>

<p>I also stream on <a href="https://livecoding.ca">my own Twitch channel</a>, but I've been busier with the DEV Twitch stream lately. I'm looking to do more on my own channel in 2022.</p>

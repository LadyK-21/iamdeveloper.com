    content: >-
      I am a big fan of TypeScript, JavaScript, Preact/React, Node and pretty much anything web. I enjoy contributing to open source. Once upon a time, I was into C#/ASP.NET. Aside from programming, I enjoy hitting the gym, snowboarding in the winter and a long long time ago, rugby.

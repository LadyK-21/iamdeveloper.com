Curious what everyone is listening to for podcasts these days, whether it be technical or not. I've been listening to Joe Rogan lately. They're long, but he has interesting guests from all walks of life. Maybe not everyone's cup of tea, but I've been enjoying his podcast.

I also recently discovered the Script & Style podcast with Todd Gardner and David Walsh. Not sure why this one hadn't already popped up on my radar.

So what are you folks all listening to these days?

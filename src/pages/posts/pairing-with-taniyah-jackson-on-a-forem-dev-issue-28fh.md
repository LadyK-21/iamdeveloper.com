I had a lot of fun with Taniyah Jackson on the pairing today. She's brand new to Ruby and Ruby on Rails and I barely have any Rails experience, so it was fun being in the hot seat.

We didn't do a tonne of coding as we were going through some fundamentals about Ruby on Rails, [Active Record](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) and [Object Relational Mappers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping) (ORM) to get us set up for working on the issue, but still great stuff.

We also talked about [polymorphic associations](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html# polymorphic-associations) in Active Record, naming convention in Rails and did a brief overview of the [MVC architecture](https://www.sitepoint.com/model-view-controller-mvc-architecture-rails).

Here's the issue that Taniyah has started working on.

Once we have a PR up, I'll update this post with a link to it.

You can check out the [full stream on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/747956751) (expires in 14 days) and/or check it out on Youtube

Taniyah is looking for her first developer role, so give her a follow on DEV and Twitter and help get her hired!

Looking forward to the next pairing and thanks again Taniyah!

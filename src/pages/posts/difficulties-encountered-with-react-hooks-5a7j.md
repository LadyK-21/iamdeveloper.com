Kent C. Dodds has a great post, [5 Tips to Help You Avoid React Hooks Pitfalls](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/react-hooks-pitfalls). There's lots of great advice in there, but I'm curious what issues all you wonderful devs on DEV have encountered in regards to React [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html).

It could be a production application or a side project you're working on. It could be a small issue you encountered or it could be a whale of an issue you struggled with.

It could be an issue that stumped you with an out of the box hook, a 3rd party hook or your own custom hook.

Go!

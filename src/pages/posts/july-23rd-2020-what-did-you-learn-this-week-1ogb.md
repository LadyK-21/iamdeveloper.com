It's that time of the week again except we're doing it a little earlier as it's [CodeLand](https://dev.to/codeland) and if you attended day 1, you probably learnt a few things. 😺

So wonderful devs, what did you learn this week? It could be programming tips, career advice etc.

And remember, if something you learnt was a big win for you, then you know where to drop it as well.👇👇🏻👇🏼👇🏽👇🏾👇🏿

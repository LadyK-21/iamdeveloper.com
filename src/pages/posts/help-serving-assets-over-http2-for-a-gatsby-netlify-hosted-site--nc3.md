Hi all. I threw out this Tweet into the Twitterverse, but thought it would be wise to ask for help here as well.

I have a Gatsby site deployed to Netlify, and some of my assets are being served over HTTP/1.1. I know that Netlify [supports HTTP/2 by default for sites enabled with HTTP2](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2017/07/18/http/2-server-push-on-netlify/).

I know that I need to add entries into my 
`_headers`
 file, e.g.


```
/
  Link: </js/example-script.js>; rel=preload; as=script
  Link: </css/example-style.css>; rel=preload; as=style
```


but it would be a pain to update this after every deploy. Is anyone aware of a gatsby plugin that might do this, or how do you go about handling this with your Gatsby site when hosted on Netlify?

I can probably generate the 
`_headers`
 file as part of my build process, but my gut tells me someone has already done this ðŸ˜‰

The source code is here if anyone is interested.

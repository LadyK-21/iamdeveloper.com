Hi DEVers,

I received some award points at work that translate to gift cards and I was looking to buy a smart watch.

I have enough to pay for the majority of an Apple watch. The one lingering question I have though is, can you put music on your Apple Watch that isn't from iTunes/Apple Music subscription? I have music in iTunes that I ripped from old CDs and ideally would like to put that on my watch. I also have some music purchased from Google Music, but I know that there is no Google Music app for Apple watches, most likely because of competition. Same for Amazon Music.

I have no plans on getting an Apple Music subscription, so if this is not possible, I am going to consider other smart watches. The other smart watch I was considering is the Fitbit Versa 2.

Any recommendations peeps?

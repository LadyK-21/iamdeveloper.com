Iâ€™ve configured webpacker to be able to [process ERBs](https://github.com/rails/webpacker# erb) (
`bundle exec rails webpacker:install:erb`
) because I need paths generated by Sprockets' 
`asset_path`
 at build time so that I get properly generated asset URLs.

The ERB integration works with the simple example that you get after installing ERB/Webpacker integration, but Iâ€™m wondering how to have access to 
`asset_path`
. From what Iâ€™ve found so far, it doesnâ€™t appear to be possible, https://github.com/rails/webpacker/issues/284.

Does anyone know if it's possible? In the meantime, I will keep digging ðŸ˜‰

I'm sure all of us wish we were better at certain things regardless of where we are in our careers. What do you wish you knew better? Post your answers in the comments.

Some people new to the platform may not be aware, but there is a mentorship program that you can [sign up for](https://dev.to/settings/mentorship). You can be a mentor, a mentee or both.

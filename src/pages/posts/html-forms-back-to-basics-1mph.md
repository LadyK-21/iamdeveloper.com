Let's forget frameworks and libraries for a moment. Today weâ€™re just going to talk about the 
`<form />`
 element and some of the things you can do with it in the DOM.

For web devs who are getting a little long in the tooth, youâ€™re probably familiar with most of this, but for newer devs, this might be news to you. Either way, buckle up because weâ€™re about to go old school with forms.

With newer DOM APIs like 
`querySelector`
 and 
`querySelectorAll`
, we can access forms via a selector, e.g. 
`document.querySelector(â€˜formâ€™);`
. Did you know that you can also access forms directly from the 
`document`
? There is an 
`HTMLCollections`
 of forms available via 
`document.forms`
. Go ahead, Iâ€™ll let you open the dev tools in your favourite editor. Pretty neat eh?

So letâ€™s say weâ€™re on [amazon.ca](https://amazon.ca).

![](https://www.iamdeveloper.com/img/form-in-dev-tools.png)

You have a form that looks like this:


```html
<form class="nav-searchbar" name="site-search">
...
</form>
```


OK, so you know there is a 
`document.forms`
 object. Letâ€™s take a peek in the dev tools.

`document.forms[0]`
 finds our form, and there is one other form on the page, but thereâ€™s also two more properties on 
`document.forms`
. Thereâ€™s 
`site-search`
 and 
`ue_backdetect`
. If we look at the markup above for our form, we see it has a 
`name`
 attribute with the value 
`â€™site-search'`
. Thatâ€™s one of the extra properties on 
`document.forms`
. Sure enough, 
`document.forms[â€˜site-searchâ€™]`
 gives us a form. If we do 
`document.forms[0] === document.forms[â€˜site-searchâ€™]`
 in the console of our dev tools, weâ€™ll see that it returns true.

If you havenâ€™t caught on yet, this means that you can access forms via an index, which represents the order they appear in the DOM, but you can also access it via a formâ€™s 
`name`
 attribute.

Alright, thereâ€™s more folks. Letâ€™s get a reference to our form by running the following in the console, 
`const siteSearchForm = document.forms['site-search']`
.

Now letâ€™s see what properties are available on our form.

![Chrome DevTools Console screenshot](https://www.iamdeveloper.com/img/form-properties.gif "Chrome DevTools Console screenshot")

OK, so we see some properties like 
`action`
, for the URL to 
`GET`
/
`POST`
 to, but as we go down the list, thereâ€™s one called 
`elements`
. Hmm, what could that be? ðŸ˜‰ If we access it in the dev tools console, we get the following:

![Chrome DevTools Console screenshot](https://www.iamdeveloper.com/img/form-in-dev-tools4.png "Chrome DevTools Console screenshot")

What? All the form inputs are in there! Thatâ€™s right folks, you have access to all the 
`<input />`
s, 
`<textarea />`
s etc via this property. Pretty cool eh? Not only that, if the form inputs have a 
`name`
 attribute, we can do the same thing we did for 
`document.forms`
. We can access the form inputs by index or their name, e.g. 
`siteSearchForm.elements[â€˜field-keywordsâ€™]`
.

So accessing forms and form inputs can be done right off the 
`document`
 via the [
`document.forms`
](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/forms) property.

One last fun fact. Each form element has a 
`form`
 property which is a reference to the 
`<form />`
 DOM node that the form element is contained within.

Hope you enjoyed this DOM Throwback Thursday.

I'm looking to buy a webcam for my home office. The one on my laptop works quite well, it's just when I'm in a video call, my laptop is to the left or right of me as my external monitor is in front of me, so you always see my side profile.

I'm looking for a webcam I can mount on my screen or sit on my desk so I'm looking directly at the webcam. Some Googling produced some decent results, e.g. [https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/peripherals/what-webcam-5-reviewed-and-rated-1027972](https://www.techradar.com/news/computing-components/peripherals/what-webcam-5-reviewed-and-rated-1027972), but I'm wondering what recommendations people may have here.

I'm not looking to break the bank on this, so probably max 100$ CAD.

Thanks in advance for any suggestions!

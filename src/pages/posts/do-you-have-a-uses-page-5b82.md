We all are particular about the software and hardware we use. Something common that came about out of all this is tech folks that blog, stream and/or give talks started getting a lot of questions like, what font do you use? What theme is that? What kind of monitor etc.

So tech folk that have web sites started creating a "uses" page. If you have a uses page, share it in the comments and consider adding it to @wesbos' awesome project [uses.tech](https://uses.tech).

If you don't have one, here is mine as an example, https://iamdeveloper.com/uses

Might as well share a workstation photo too while you're at it.

Go!

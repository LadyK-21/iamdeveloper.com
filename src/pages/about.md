## Who Is This Guy?

<img class="headshot" src="/images/colour-headshot-500x500.jpg" alt="Headshot of Nick Taylor" />

Hi! My name is Nick Taylor.

I'm a developer advocate at [Pomerium](https://pomerium.com), a zero trust, identity-aware proxy platform that enables secure, clientless connections to web applications and services without a corporate VPN.

i have over a decade of open source contributions and five years of professional open source experience at companies like OpenSauced, dev.to, and Netlify. Youâ€™ll often find me live streaming tech content, either solo or with friends from the community.

Although I'm a huge fan of open source, I'm not a big fan of spiders.

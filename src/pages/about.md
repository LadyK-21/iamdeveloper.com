## Who Is This Guy?

Hi! My name is Nick Taylor.

I'm a Developer Advocate who’s still very much an engineer at heart. I focus on empowering developers by building real solutions, sharing practical insights, and creating spaces where people can grow and succeed.

At [Pomerium](https://pomerium.com), I'm expanding into infrastructure and security, working hands-on with Zero Trust access, authentication, authorization policies, and cloud-native networking. I believe great DevRel starts by staying close to the code and grounded in real-world workflows.

[I contribute to open source](https://github.com/nickytonline), build technical demos, write deep-dive posts, [give talks](/talks), and surface developer feedback — all to make developers more effective.

I'm passionate about growing inclusive communities, amplifying developer voices, and making complex technologies more accessible.

Areas of interest: infrastructure, security, open source, developer tooling, frontend ecosystems (especially React/JavaScript), and improving developer workflows.

Wanna get in touch? Drop me an e-mail at nick at nickyt dot co.

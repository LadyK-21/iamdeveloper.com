My name is Nick Taylor. I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Forem](https://www.forem.com/)/[DEV](https://dev.to) working on all things Forem. I am a <em>big</em> fan of TypeScript, JavaScript, (P)React and Node. Once upon a time, I was into C#/ASP.NET. Aside from programming, I enjoy hitting the gym, snowboarding, and a long long time ago, rugby. I am also not a big fan of spiders.

I enjoy contributing to open source. Here are some highlights of my most recent open source work.

-   Helped the [Chroma](https://hichroma.com) team with some [frontend DX for their markdown files](https://github.com/chromaui/learnstorybook.com/pull/181)
-   I enabled automatic dependency updates for this site using Netlify, Dependabot and Cypress. You can read about it in my post, [Update Dependencies with Dependabot, Cypress and Netlify](/posts/update-dependencies-with-dependabot-cypress-and-netlify-3lkf/).
-   [Helped Migrate the Refined GitHub extension to TypeScript](https://github.com/sindresorhus/refined-github/commits?author=nickytonline)
-   [dev.to repository](https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/commits?author=nickytonline). I gained early access to the repository while it was still private and was the [first developer to contribute](https://dev.to/jess/dev-monthly-report--march-2018-579p) to the repository outside of the core team. Since then I have contributed quite a bit to the codebase, mainly in the frontend. I also cross-post my blog posts to [dev.to](https://dev.to/nickytonline). I actually work for them now, so I guess it was a good idea contributing to the repository. ðŸ˜‰
-   [coryhouse/react-slingshot Â· GitHub](https://github.com/coryhouse/react-slingshot/commits?author=nickytonline). I contributed quite a bit to this repository when I started to learn React/Redux and then I was asked and accepted to become a maintainer of the repository.
-   [Converting tota11y to a browser extension](https://github.com/Khan/tota11y/pull/131). This is not merged but you can use this PR as an unpacked browser extension. For more information, see my post, [An a11y extension coming to a browser near you](/posts/an-a11y-extension-coming-to-a-browser-near-you-1mg2/).

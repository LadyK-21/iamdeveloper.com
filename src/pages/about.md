My name is Nick Taylor. I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Forem](https://www.forem.com/), the software that powers [DEV](https://dev.to) working on all things Forem. I am a <em>big</em> fan of TypeScript, JavaScript, (P)React and Node. Once upon a time, I was into C#/ASP.NET. Aside from programming, I enjoy hitting the gym, snowboarding, and a long long time ago, rugby. I am also not a big fan of spiders. I also enjoy contributing to open source.

I'm super happy at Forem. It's my first dream job. I'm paid to work in open source, work with awesome folk, work with the developer community, live stream, and to top it off, it's remote. It checks off so many boxes for me. Having said that, if you're ever able to potentially top all that, feel free to contact me. If you're curious what it's like to work with me, check out any of the [live streaming I do](/live-coding/). If you're curious what my work looks like, check out my [GitHub](http://github.com/nickytonline).

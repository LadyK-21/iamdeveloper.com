## Who Is This Guy?

I am a Staff Software Engineer at [Netlify](https://netlify.com), working on the ecosystem team, ensuring your favourite frameworks deploy seamlessly on our platform. I also [stream on Twitch](https://livecoding.ca).

I am a <em>big</em> fan of TypeScript, JavaScript, Node, and all things frontend. Aside from programming, I enjoy contributing to open source, hitting the gym, snowboarding, and rugby a long time ago.

I'm new to Netlify, but I've been a fan of the product for a long time. I get to work with amazing humans on cool stuff in open-source, and I get to interact with the developer community. That's pretty awesome.

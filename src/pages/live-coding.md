I [started live coding](/posts/i-ve-started-to-live-code-on-twitch-for-dev-13cn/) earlier this year on Twitch. It started off as a small experiment, and then I started getting into a groove. Initially I was live coding by myself, but then I thought it might be fun and helpful to engage with the folks that contribute to the open source project I work on, [Forem](https://forem.com), the code that runs [DEV](https://dev.to). So I asked the DEV community if [anyone was interested](/let-s-pair-during-a-live-coding-session-8he/) in pairing and folks definitely were. I did my [first pairing with Sophia Li](/posts/live-coding-pairing-converting-a-preact-component-to-use-hooks-75e/) near the end of July 2020.

The goal of these pairings is a few things:

-   It's potentially intimidating for people to contribute to an open source project, so why not help them out?
-   Some folks are looking to land there first role. I thought this could be a great way to give them some exposure and confidence to help them along their way to landing that first role while contributing to a real world code base.
-   They are [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) because we are streaming on the Internet.
-   It's fun meeting people from the community.
-   I potentially get to learn new things as well!

Hacktoberfest 2020 is right around the corner so I'll be pairing a lot more in October for issues in the Forem codebase to help folks get to that goal of 4 merged pull requests for Hacktoberfest. If you haven't already signed up for [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), there's still time.

And if you do plan on participating in Hacktoberfest 2020, be sure to check out my talk [Getting the Most Out of Open Source](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tech_talks/getting-the-most-out-of-open-source) on October 1st.

If you want to check out my stream, visit [livecoding.ca](https://livecoding.ca). And if you're interested in pairing, [hit me up on Twitter](https://twitter.com/nickytonline) or send me a [direct message on DEV](https://dev.to/nickytonline).

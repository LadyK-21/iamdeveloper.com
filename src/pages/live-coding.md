I [started live coding](/posts/i-ve-started-to-live-code-on-twitch-for-dev-13cn/) on Twitch at the end of March 2020. It started off as a small experiment, and then I started getting into a groove. Initially I was live coding by myself, but then I thought it might be fun and helpful to engage with the folks that contribute to the open source project I work on, [Forem](https://forem.com), the code that runs [DEV](https://dev.to).

<h2 id="pair">Live Code Pairings</h2>

So I asked the DEV community if [anyone was interested](/let-s-pair-during-a-live-coding-session-8he/) in pairing and folks definitely were. I did my [first pairing with Sophia Li](/posts/live-coding-pairing-converting-a-preact-component-to-use-hooks-75e/) near the end of July 2020.

The goal of these pairings is a few things:

- It's potentially intimidating for people to contribute to an open source project, so why not help them out?
- Some folks are looking to land their first role. I thought this could be a great way to give them some exposure and confidence to help them along their way to landing that first role while contributing to a real world code base.
- They are [learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public/) because we are streaming on the Internet.
- It's fun meeting people from the community.
- I potentially get to learn new things as well!

I initially started pairing on my stream, but since the pairings are all [Forem](https://github.com/forem/forem/) based, I've been doing them on the [DEV Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/thepracticaldev). If you want to pair on something non-Forem based, we can pair on my own stream.

<h3 id="walkthrough-wed">Walkthrough Wednesdays</h3>

I thought this would be a fun way to explore the tech in Forem, but it can also be used for going through features in Forem and even non-Forem related stuff, like explaining some sort of tech.
